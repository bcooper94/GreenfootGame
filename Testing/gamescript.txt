(Haahh. Finally some free time for once!
(so it's time to start something new!
(...Wow, a lot of these games are so nostalgic!
(Oh? This one...)
((Un)Real ...This was an RPG right?)
(Something about mercenaries named 'The Guild' 
(If I remember right, a samurai, a 'phantom' and a thief
to stop a rebellion started by an invading country...)
(Hmm... I don't really remember the details too well...
You take the game out of its box 
(Huh? How did this happen?)
You reach out to touch it and suddenly  
(Aah... what? Where... where am I? It's so dark...)
(What's with these clothes? They're like... silk robes.)
"Go look around! They must be somewhere nearby!"
(Someone's coming this way... Maybe they can 
"Ah!"
"Umm excuse me-"
The person suddenly draws their sword
"Die!"
"Ack!"
You pivot on your heel and 
(What?! What's with this person?!)
"Over here! Hurry!"
(I have to do something! Have to get away!)
*Insert battle sequence*
(Huff... Huff...)
(They're still after me!)
Someone suddenly grabs your arm as you pass by
"Hey~ Can you stop moving? They keep chasing
(Who the heck is this?!)
"Let go of me!"
"Whoa! Chill! I just-"
"Hand that person over!"
"Now, now. Just a second..."
"I'll kill you!"
"Yaaah-! Urgh-!"
The man suddenly falls to the ground, revealing
"Tch... Pathetic."
"Reake! You're late!"
"Shut it. You're noisy."
"Hey, hey. You're going to make a bad
(Client? Does he mean me?)
"Like I care about a stranger's opinion."
(Come to think of it, these people seem kind of 
"Well? Who is this person?"
"Haven't asked yet."
"..."
(Where have I seen them before...?)
"More importantly, was this event supposed to
"I thought it was later on."
"You probably screwed it up somehow I bet."
"Ouch."
"Anyways, I'm Crait! May I be so bold as to ask 
"Ah! You two are from the game! 'The Guild'!
(I wonder if they're cosplayers or something?
(It's not like I got sucked into the game or
"What, you already know."
"I didn't tell 'em anything though..."
"Hnn... You. Are you an information broker?
(Who would admit to being a spy...?)
"Or a stalker?!"
"I am not!"
"I bet you watch us for hours on end 
"I never-!"
"..."
(Well... I guess I sort of did when I was 
(But that's beside the point!)
"Hey. They're coming."
"Mm. Let's bounce."
"Hey, can you run? If not I can carry you~"
(No way!) 
"Why should I go with you?!"
"Relax! You know who we are, don't you?
(Someone hired The Guild to protect me?)
"Tch. Hey. Move it. Otherwise I'll leave you to die."
"You're a terrible mercenary, Reake."
"Don't worry, he's actually a very nice person."
"...I think."

"...Enemy."
"How many?"
"Just one."
"Heading towards base."
"Shall I clean up?"
"If they're a magic user..."
(It's so dark I can't see anything. Where... Huh?)
*Enemy Information shows up*
(Is that... the GUI?! (Un)Real's GUI?!)
"They're... They're a normal swordsman."
"!!!"
"What are you basing this on?"
"Err... that's..."
"I believe 'em!"
"You!..."
"Anything else you know about the enemy?"
"How much HP they have and their levels..."
"Level?"
"Pointless. I'm attacking.
"Hey! ..."
"Well let's go help him out. Can't hurt, right?"
*Battle Starts* 
(It really is the GUI from the game...
"Hey. Can you follow my instructions?"
"Listen to you? You think you're better at
"Why not, Reake? Amuse us a bit~. 
"Tch..."
*After the fight* 
"Hahh. Not bad!"
"..."
"We're going."
Crait sighs.
"He's really not a very honest person, huh?"
*Enters base*
"We're back!!!"
"Welcome back! Is this our client?"
"Yup~! Got attacked by the revolutionists."
"Revolutionists?!"
"If that's so... you... could you be...?"
"This person's the successor to the throne."
(Wha-?! What?!)
"Eh?! Really?!"
"No! I'm not!"
"There's no mistake."
"But-!"
"I agree. There are wanted posters of you in
"...Okay, before that."
"Weren't you hired to save me?
"The request was very vague."
"'Please rescue the person at this place
"Isn't that dangerous?! What if it was a trap?!"
"We're not afraid of danger."
"You don't get very far in this occupation
"The job was interesting so we went for it but..."
"The money we got isn't nearly enough to cover
"I thought so."
"Then? What do you want to do? The job's technically
"There are revolutionists everywhere in this city."
"Doesn't matter. That's irrelevant to the mission."
"Isn't the fact I'm not actually royalty relevant?!"
"Enough."
"Wait, Reake. Let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt.
"Those clothes seem to suggest otherwise, but I agree
"At the very least we can listen to what 
(If telling them the truth keeps them from abandoning
(Let's just hope they don't come to the conclusion
"I'm not actually supposed to be in this world."
"This place is a part of (Un)Real, which is the

"...So they say."
"...You don't believe me, huh?"
"Now, now. We didn't say that~."
"Well either way. If we throw the only child of the

"So if we're screwed no matter what, let's do what's
"At the very least we can bring you back to the
"I'm down for that."
"Fine."
"I don't need to go to the palace though!
"Hey, hey. Calm down~. You'll like it more at
(!!!)
"Th-That's my room!"
"Whaaaat? Your room? No, no. This is the palace!
"...Are you messing with me?"
"Stop screwing around."
"Yeah! You hear that, Crait?!"
"You don't even know what your own home looks like?
"Wha-?! Even you Reake?!"
Yua giggles.
"Anyways, that's where you wanted to go right?
(Did they know the whole time who I was?)
(...Urgh! Whatever!)

"Be careful okay? There are bound to be enemies 
"Not that we'll lose that easily either though!"
"Ah that's right. You can see the GU- I mean, the 
"We'll be counting on you to guide us, okay?"
"Uh huh. SURE."
Reake sighs.
"Idiot."
*after reaching the palace*
"...Enemy."
"What?! This is the palace though, isn't it?!"
"Technically we're at the royal family's villa.
"Either way it's strange that the gates were left
"revolution going on."
"Yeah. If the villa's already been taken over
"Well we can at least check out the inside. Maybe 
"Or a way to get somewhere safe."
*return to action world / after reaching final room*
(That's my bedroom's door!)
"!!! Get behind me!"
"! ...They're not supposed to be here."
"Yeah... But then how...? Is it because there's a...
"Ah! You mean a bug in the system!"
Yua swiftly punches Crait in the head.
"Ouch!"
"That's not funny when you do it, Yua. T_T"
(...By 'bug' do they mean me?)
"Prepare yourself."
"Huh?"
"Your final boss is just inside."
"The final boss? You mean the revolutionary leader?"
"YOUR final boss. ...You'll understand once you
*introduce final boss*
"!!!"
"S***! That's right! I have a project
"This is no joke! I need to get home as soon
"Hahaha! Relax! It's just a game. At least enjoy
*after the battle*
"We've won."
"Yeah! Great job! Your instructions were brilliant!"
"For real though! I've always respected you, you
"Thanks."
*bright light shines on you*
"Wha-?!"
"What are you so afraid of? You wanted to go home,
"So this is the end, huh? Too bad. Even though
"You guys..."
"At least you'll be safe now! Have a nice trip!
"...Take care."
"Come back and play with us some time!"
